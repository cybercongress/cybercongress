      <description>Today for most humans is just another day. But historically this day is important because the Genesis of Cosmos Hub happens.

 Almost 4 years ago in a day of Ethereum Genesis, I wrote a post on its bright future. This accelerating future is happening right now.
Current post is not the comparison between Ethereum and Cosmos or Polkadot or other amazing p2p technology. Nor it is an overview of the technology.</description>

      <description>January 3, 2019, we&amp;rsquo;ve launched first public testnet Euler-3. Since this time we have 3 relaunches and much more we&amp;rsquo;ll has in the future. Thanks to our testers and validators we&amp;rsquo;re finding and fixing new bugs every day. But now one fundamental and critical bug is not fixed yet. Currently, we have just 2 seed nodes and they able to upload data and provide connection to other nodes. Unfortunately, this is not about decentralization.</description>

      <description>If something wrong&amp;hellip; First of all I would like to encourage you to use --help feature if you want to get better experience of using cyberdcli. This is really easy way to find all necessary commands with options and flags.
For example you can enter:
docker exec cyberd cyberdcli --help  You should see this message:
Command line interface for interacting with cyberd Usage: cyberdcli [command] Available Commands: status Query remote node for status query Querying subcommands tx Transactions subcommands keys Add or view local private keys rest-server Start LCD (light-client daemon), a local REST server version Print the app version link Create and sign a link tx help Help about any command Flags: --chain-id string Chain Id of cyberd node -e, --encoding string Binary encoding (hex|b64|btc) (default &amp;quot;hex&amp;quot;) -h, --help help for cyberdcli --home string directory for config and data (default &amp;quot;/root/.</description>

      <description>Glossary Bandwidth - The recovered unit of your account. Used to complete transactions in the cyberd blockchain. The amount of your bandwidth calculates like:
your_cyb_tokens / all_cyb_tokens_in_cyberd * 2000*1000*100.
Messages cost is 500 (exclude link). Transaction consists of one or more messages m_1, m_2, ..., m_n. Transaction cost is 300 + c_1 + c_2 ... + c_n, where c_i - cost of m_i message. Full bandwidth regeneration time is 86400 blocks (24 hours)</description>

Сonclusion This sprint was not easy for us. We had worked on bug fixing and improvements, and, also, adapted to the new climate.
What exactly is ready? Testnet Euler drives like hell. It&amp;rsquo;s too easy now to launch own node or validator and start linking principally new Internet.
Is it hard to? Alright! Testnet Euler is now available in cyb. So you can link the new Internet with great UX.</description>

      <description>What is this The cyberd is a public Delegated Proof-of-Stake (DPoS) protocol based on Tendermint Byzantine Fault-Tolerant consensus, meaning that validator&amp;rsquo;s weight is determined by the amount of staking tokens bonded as collateral. These tokens can be staked directly by the validator or delegated to them by token holders. The weight (i.e. total stake) of a validator determines whether or not it is an active validator, and also how frequently this node will have to propose a block and how much revenue it will obtain.</description>

Сonclusion Briefly.
After a successful launch we have faced a few problems with our blockchain: - not enough validators - rapid blocks generation - confused naming
Good news: we have solved it already, but validators are still welcome!
Secondly, we&amp;rsquo;ve prepared a whitepaper 0.4. It&amp;rsquo;s still immature, but for launched testnet with economic incentives it makes sense.
I need to remind once again for all who care about web3 and decentralized search engine to join the discussion in our telegram dev chat.</description>

Сonclusion 42 . This number has haunted us. I&amp;rsquo;m not kidding. 42 participants came to our conference, cyberc0n, and now there are 42 members in our dev chat. Mystic&amp;hellip;
However it was a new year sprint! We have done quite a lot in this sprint and are proud of that!
What exactly we are proud of? First public testnet. What does it mean for you? You can do your best for the future Internet with testing our chain as a validator.</description>

Сonclusion We have a rich and crazy sprint. A lot of things happened during the last three weeks. And&amp;hellip; You know what? We want to collect just good things among the array of events.
First of all, let&amp;rsquo;s speak about our products state. Soon, on Bitcoin genesis block 10th year anniversary, 2019.01.03, we&amp;rsquo;ll launch cyberd first testnet - Euler, Cyb 0.1.0 Euler release, and Chaingear mainnet with updated UI.</description>

      <description>First Week in Dragonereum One week ago I wrote about Dragonereum. One week passed since the launch &amp;hellip; And I have some really exciting numbers to you.
Some in-game results  More than 1&amp;frasl;3 of genesis EGGs sold out. 2400 DRAGONs can live forever! More than 250 addresses in the game More than 7500 fights done! That is 3 fights per dragon or 30 (!) per address 28k transactions. That is more than 100 per address.</description>

Hi everyone! Today we&amp;rsquo;ll take one giant step to regular Cyb using.
At this time import of account is available just with the private key. All private keys are encrypted and stored at local storage.
 Disclaimer: Cyb in Ethereum Mainnet may not be secure yet. We recommend to operate accounts with small balance at your own risk.
 After successful installation and launching of the latest version Cyb you should see the screen like this:</description>

This article for Dragonereum players who was faced with trouble around Chrome, Mozilla, Opera + Metamask using. We want to explain why and how to play Dragonereum with a pure web3 browser.
The first question we want to address is why someone may need to use another browser instead of Chrome?
Speed The truth is that real blockchain gaming is brand new thing. We know that gaming require fast interactions.</description>

Hi! As we know from an earlier post we need 3 green lights on the right side of the footer. Today we&amp;rsquo;ll add ETH node to Cyb. We&amp;rsquo;ll use Parity node as an example, but you can try Geth node if you feel strong enough.
Installing Parity-node The easiest way to install the stable version of Parity is Homebrew. Run this command in terminal:

      <description>The history of contemporary web technologies is very interesting. Every time something truly exciting begins then peoples from all over the world meet around &amp;ldquo;some not obvious for every joe&amp;rdquo; idea.
Global Ethereum community started from devcon0.
Web3 community started from web3 summit. Community around zero knowledge started from Zcon0. Robonomics community started from Robonomics 2017.
Last 5 years I witnessing tremendous pace of development of consensus computing. Starting from naive bitcoin forks we went from slow, dumb and expensive distributed ledgers to the state of the art consensus computers with ultimate privacy, consensus computers with self-evolving capabilities, consensus computers who are able to prove computing costs ahead of execution, consensus computers who is able to execute a code written (almost) in any language, mesh-like consensus computers, consensus computers which are prepared for quantum computing era.</description>

      <description>Web3 [GAV] is coming. This can shift existing web&amp;rsquo;s ubiquitously used client-server architecture to truly peer-to-peer interactions based on stateless IPFS and variety of stateful consensus computers such as Ethereum.
In the following series of posts, I would love to discuss opportunities behind consensus search engine, challenges of crawling, indexing, and evaluation for the next generation web and eventually propose a consensus computer implementation.
But first, let us start a discussion from disadvantages of general-purpose search engines:</description>

      <description>by @savetheales
Hey everyone! Today we&amp;rsquo;ll make the glorious step into adulthood! The greatest level of Cyb using is when you have 3 greenlights on the right side of footer ;)
Cyb uses color indication to show your connection status. Green indicator means that you have connection to local node, yellow one is for remote node and red one is for no connection at all.
So today we intend to add local IPFS node to our Cyb.</description>

      <description>Today is special day. After one year of development Dragonereum will be born. For me this is a very important milestone and in this post I will explain you why.
Last time I dedicated the whole post for some blockchain system 3.5 years ago. That was also very special day: We launch Ethereum. Those post was not very popular. Nobody those days give a shit to the most important developments.</description>

Сonclusion So, first of all, what are we looking for? We want a growth. Slowly, patiently, organic growth. Thats&amp;rsquo;s we&amp;rsquo;re looking for.
That is why our focus now on Cyb. We start to support our first 3rd-party app Dragonereum. Don&amp;rsquo;t think it&amp;rsquo;s all pleasure, there are a lot of troubles there. But we want to use Cyb at Dragonereum genesis, so the next couple of days will be hard ;) Also we need to add some security measures to make it more safer (not safe, sorry) in the mainnet.</description>

Hi everyone! Today I intend to show you how to open web3 link with our web3 browser. If you have read our last post you should have noticed IPFS hash at back matter. The thing is that we have web3 blog :)
First of all download latest version of our Сyb and install it.
Next click on a Сyb icon. You can see something like this
This is the Root Registry by the way, but we will talk later about this.</description>

Hi everyone! In our agreement phrase &amp;ldquo;open-source&amp;rdquo; appears for six times! Not bad for 2 pages of agreement, isn&amp;rsquo;t it? We believe in this mighty power and have no vision of evolution without it.
Today I want to provide insights into our communication with open-source community and collaboration process.
A little bit more than half of the year ago we learned gitcoin. For more details you can explore their platform.</description>

We are a community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen which is build around some arbitrary consensus and is founded by @litvintech, @hleb-albau and me.
We have so much of exciting ideas but in the following years we are going to focus on web3. We feel that browsing, search and database technology can be moved towards more open and accessible internet: the internet for our generations.</description>

Сonclusion Such a productive sprint! Seriously. We combined 21 and 22 sprints because in a second one was too codeless. Also we got useful acquaintances but more about that later.
First of all we update our web3 vision by @xhipster. It&amp;rsquo;s early draft for web3 summit but we have choose direction to develop for now. Also this vision includes our DURA spec that must displace URLs.</description>

With our attempts to create cyberd PoC based on Cosmos SDK we hit at performance bug of Tendermint and Cosmos. Moreover it&amp;rsquo;s huge problems with multithreading. For now we want to add current implementation to Cyb for tests. But in spite of performance problems we&amp;rsquo;ll not give up the Cosmos SDK as a base for cyberd in the near future.</description>
