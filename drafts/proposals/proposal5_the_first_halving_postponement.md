title: The First Halving Postponement

description: This is signaling a proposal for a manual halving_period parameter shift in the code. The postponement of the halving_period for minting Voltes and Amperes is proposed.\n\n

The halving_period is a number of blocks where the price of Volts and Amperes minting is double. The first halving supposes to be at block height 9000000, or 18 months. This parameter was modulated by the assumption that the Gift was released right after the network launch. This did not happen due to unstable CosmWasm module, need for additional design and development. \n\n

In the current state, the possibility of minting Volts and Amperes for the gifted is decreasing every day. To avoid that, the postponement of the first and only the first halving is proposed. \n\n

By voting Yes I agree with the first halving postponement by 6000000 blocks (from 18 months to 30) via the next software upgrade proposal.
