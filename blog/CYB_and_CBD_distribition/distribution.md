# A note about CBD and CYB Distribution

This note should be perceived, as context, upon reading [euler release notes](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/master/docs/cyberd.md).

The main purpose of this note - is to explain the logic behind our decisions, on the distribution of CBD and CYB, and prove to you that the decisions we made, have a sensible balance of risk, taking into account the possibilities of the project.

We wish to be as transparent and as honest as possible, with our community. Because of this, some of the revealed information may seem strange and unaccustomed to you. We fully understand this, please be so kind in understanding us in return.

## One

The first important moment is that even though PoS is so fucking ecologically effective, it does put project creators in a very uncomfortable situation in approaching initial token distribution.

This means that the network cannot simply take and receive bonds from validators as if those tokens just suddenly appeared out of nowhere. In PoW, things are simple. You burn some electricity - you create tokens. With PoS, the legend is still filled with mist, as to how tokens are created :-)

And on that thought, it is obvious that the initial distribution must be proven with PoW. This is with consideration to the difficult times of today, when any fool is able to make an ASIC. Of course, one can create or use something like [ProgPOW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW) or Ethash, with tons of clever parameters. But those won't last you for long. So, if you really believe that PoW will get us to the point where all our [trees are eaten by caterpillars](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C), then you aren't really left with many choices for making a distribution that won't harm your project.

Looking at the bigger picture, there are only two proven ways of doing so:

## Drop 'em

This is a great way to prove that users are using what you have created. A drop is the most effective, and up to date way of attracting users. Drops of BTC attract billions of dollars if 100% tokens of a new system has been dropped. But, those are only possible if you do not need to invest in the code base. If your project is written from scratch, because, it indeed, offers something new, then the project must have both - money and developers. This is simply because developers eat only money indeed.  

## Collecting dough

A very effective way of "feeding" devs with money, is to feed them the money that the investors have brought to the table. But out of those that send you that money, there will always be those, that aren't the "happy bunch", and the project will have to live with it. Bitcoin, for example, didn't have this negativity, as it simply couldn't have had it. If one single person doesn't have the money for covering the projects costs (meanwhile only Satoshi and the guys from Grin have managed to pull this off), then you are put with the necessity of taking money, either from those you trust, or from everyone. Attracting money from everyone is always a risk for the project. Especially now, when the regulators don't give a fuck for basic logic. This is why, private investments from people you trust are the way forward, especially if the project can do it quickly and effectively. This is the way we will move go by in order to fund our project and to bring it up to stable mode. Also, this will allow us to focus more on development, as the resources burned on investor relations are always fierce.

## Two

The second important moment is that the distribution must always solve an issue. In its essence, any proven distribution is a mix between different capitals, that brings us to the current state of the system (whether successful or not). Simply understanding who and how receives your token can mean a lot, if not basically everything :-)

Our project has (almost) the classical problem of the egg, the dragon, and money. What we need to do, is to make a connection between developers and normal crypto users, in such a way, where those who have the capital are also willing to help. This means, that we achieve a state where the capital, simultaneously, has to be in the hands of the "average" user and in the hands of those, who have contributed that capital. And of course, most importantly, in the hands of the developers.  

## For Developers

This brings us to the understanding that part of the distribution has to be distributed to developers. In our case, most of the code was written by ourselves, this means that we have either already received a substantial part of the allocation, or will receive it, upon completing the development. Another substantial part of what is allocated to the developers will be used for useful experimenting. Tokens will be allocated to three (for the time being) experiments in the field of network swarming: Gitcoin, Aragon and Colony.  

## Three

The third part of the story is that we still have to find a balance between the market depth (the investors) and between the engineering thought (the developers). Because, if this is not done, then the developers will simply fork you out, and of course, this is not good for the investors. Because in an organic ecosystem (like Ethereum), the investors religiously believe in the developers, and it looks as synergic as it can get. If it will be the other way around - where the developers believe religiously in the investor's - nothing will ever get done, it just won't fucking work.

We have decided to go in the direction where the money and the code are of equal value. Both groups get 15% of the distribution (each). And the users get the other 70% of CBD tokens.

The main purpose of this note - is to show the potential contributors that the existing valuation has been formed upon actual and valid contributions. This also means, that in the future, there won't be a situation where one type of actor gets their tokens for a lesser value than was formed during the Genesis contribution.

The truth is that we want to get rid of the distribution question, as quickly as possible. But, the project needs a throughout initial capital structure, both in economical and in human terms. This is in order for the project to become something meaningful and worthwhile, and to be able to compete with the giants out there.  

## Summing up the distribution of CBD tokens

- Proof of code: 15% for those who write code
- Proof of dough: 15% for those who contribute the dough
- Proof of use: 70% for at least 1 million of (at least) Ethereum users

At the time of Genesis of the mainnet, the owners of CBD tokens will get the lion's share of CYB tokens. This is with the exception to the inflation, that is allocated to validators of the mainnet, which will be in between 3% to 10%, depending on when the network is launched.  

## Utility testnet

It is important to understand the difference between an average blockchain testnet and our euler testnet! Our testnet can be utilized and can be used for searching already! The links will be persistent from testnet to testnet! Because of this - it can hold 1% of monetary value within itself.

By this we are solving a rather difficult issue, which is related to the delivery of complicated and productive networks and smart contract systems. Usually, those can develop for years. This is why we have decided to build our rocket during real flight time. On one hand, we already have something to show. Something that is working already! And we want people to use it. Also our ranking system is based on pure economics, so we can conclude nothing from running zero value testnet. On the other hand, because the code is still young, monetary issues can arise. This is why we have decided to find a compromise, in the light of using CBD - an Ethereum based token, and CYB - the mainnet token.  

## Proof-of-value: 15%

Those who donated dough can be roughly divided into 2 groups:

The first group is the dough that will go to cyberCongress:
- The Genesis team round: 4.1592% - has already been done in the beginning of 2018. It is valued at 30k ETH. There was no software prior to this.

> It is worth noting here, that all further valuations of the project, from the moment it was conceived, were based on the fact, that for two years the project was solely being donated by the guys from the cyberCongress team: that is - 110.2 BTC + 380 ETH. 4.1592% of the CBD distribution was allocated to the team for the above contributions.

- A winter round of donations from friends: will vary at between 2.1153% to 4.1153%. This round is actually in progress right now.

The second group, is the dough that will go to cyberFoundation:

- Between 6.7255% to 8.7255%, depending on the volumes of the donations during the winter round. This is an [Aragon organization](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cyberfoundation.aragonid.eth/0xf4d85b5a1650a335b30072d178f6dcb611f05a3e) that will generate its capital through a public auction from the CBD tokens that has been allocated to them. The auction will be similar to that of EOS, with the only difference, that the collected dough will not go to cyberCongress, but, will be under the control of the community itself, i.e. of the DAO. Taking into account the fact that this, is in essence, the only opportunity for validators to purchase tokens in big amounts, I presume the auction can collect at least 10k ETH over the next one and a half years.

## Proof-of-code: 15%

Those who have contributed code can be roughly divided into 3 groups:

- Congress and inventors (developers): 8.4%  
- The team: 3.8%  
- A wider community of contributors: 2.8%

One can say, that the logic was as follows: the team calculated the valuation of its options, based on the amount of personal investment and reasonable goals.

Congress:
>8.4% in actual money, estimated at $10M / 3 people / 30 months = ~10k$ per person, per month, into one hand, according to current estimates

The team:
>3.8% in actual money, estimated at $10M / 9 people / 18 months = ~ 1.8k $ per person, per month, into one hand, according to current estimates

Contributors:

This category will include things like bounties for simple translation work, and also bounties for more serious work, such as: protocol implementation in alternative programming languages, security bounty, and so on. About half of this sum will be distributed via Gitcoin, under the control of the Congress. The second half is going to be allocated towards the creation of [cyberColony](https://colony.io/).

Since some members of the Congress will also be the founders of cyberColony, there should be no risk of cheap token leakage, but of course, those may arise.

## Proof-of-use: 70%

The details of the distribution can be found in the release notes, but a lion's share of the distribution, 70% - to be precise, will go towards the drop. We have six more attempts to optimize the drop. Each further attempt should be more efficient than the previous one. We will try to apply some scientific methods in between the drops in order to optimize them. As a result, over the horizon of between one to two years, we hope to achieve the highest possible effective distribution, for the users who were most helpful in the space of cybernomics.

Individual addresses will be allocated between %0.0003 and %0.000003, this is equal to between 30 dollars and 0.3 dollars when evaluating at $10M. I assume that these numbers are reasonable, in order not to expect any mass dumping of tokens by the users.

Nevertheless, I expect that the current configuration of the distribution is able to generate demand in order to compensate for the supply, even for as much as, one hundred thousand users. The fact is, based upon experience in other networks, the validator market will strive for 60% of the supply. Provided that the tokens can be bought or earned in a number of ways, just for 30% of the total supply - there will be roughly 30% demand, which can only be obtained from different users. In reality, most validators will only have access to the stake which forms cyberFoundation, this is equal to round about 8%, which in turn, will build an even stronger demand for the token, during its early stages from the validators themselves. We should also not cross out the users who will see value in the token.

The purpose of approaching distribution is this way - is to give Ethereum's active users the minimum possible bandwidth. This is done in order to value the advantages of distributed search. It is unlikely that any of the addresses that received a drop will have enough tokens to become a validator, the only way for this to occur is during the very beginning of the life of the network, when the market of validators has not yet formed any competition.

## After Genesis

Towards the Genesis, the phase at which you can prove something to someone, will come to an end. Meaning - that with code, money or by use, you won't be able to prove anything to anyone anymore :-)  

After Genesis, the network will move onto a stage, where new tokens will only be generated by the validators.

From this moment on, the validators will receive a fixed amount of token per block: 1 000 000 000 CYB. This will be the base consensus for the monetary policy.

The reason for choosing an inflationary system, was because we believe that the transactional margin has to flow to those who fulfil the most important task. Our knowledge graph will not be possible to calculate without the validators. This means, that if we wish to use the network's bandwidth for eternity, we have to guarantee the validators a life long cover of their costs from a fixed level of never-ending inflation.

The longer the system exists, the less value will the relative inflation have.

## So why do we have two tokens after all?

Technically we could have not had an ERC-20 token, nevertheless, there was a whole bunch of reasons found, why we do need it.

1. ERC-20 tokens are good for accounting options for the team and for vendors until the network is 100% productive

2. The process making CYB token liquid is a long one. Some steps taken before the launch of the network can help the project develop

3. We have other side projects that can help us to make the token of this project stronger, for example: cyberAcademia and Chaingear

4. We want to actively develop the community on Gitcoin, but doing so with tokens from an outside network - is impossible. We need an ERC-20 token in order to have more non-fiat stimulus for the contributors.

5. We love Ethereum and we want to live in it :-)

6. Aragon is finally working, so it is "a must", to try out the Aragon organizations

7. Forming an Ethereum based community on the basis of CBD tokens, to which part of the CYB tokens is allocated, in such a way - where 100% of the money is controlled by the community itself, looks too tempting in order not to give it a try. This is because we must try and have another go at repeating the DAO's success.

As a result we ended up with CBD tokens, which are a kind of a community token on the Ethereum network already, it can already grant you different super skills and give you different artifacts. We see our Ethereum based tokens as a side effect of organising the process, rather then our main super power. Our main super power is - of course, the CYB token, because they are the once that give you the possibility of validating and ranking. But we do not plan on throwing CBD out after the launch of the mainnet. It is a cool thing that can have many uses and help us to do achieve many cool things.

## Long term perspective

The starting distribution might seem a bit more complicated in comparison to a Satoshi-style one. But, it solves the current tasks of the project - that of the egg, the dragon, and the dough.  

After the activation of the `merkle` network, the structure of the distribution becomes rather simple and validator orientated. The main task of the model will be providing the computing consensus with the needed resources for the actualization of the publicly available knowledge graph.

Whilst developing this distribution, we were trying to keep in mind the following things:

- balance of risks for the projets participants
- financing the project `at the needed level and no more`
- ensuring long term incentives to the capital structure

![CYB.md](http://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmSn6iU53MS4hr3xRYS18YAAt1vkmgnn2JYzjuLYiWDrVG)

The model illustrated above assumes, that the project will achieve the `merkle` stage on block 50 000 000. Based upon this scenario, initial investors and developers share, will be equal to ~13.4% after 10 years and only to ~5.7% after 30 years.

# Заметка к дистрибьюции CBD и CYB

Эту заметку стоит воспринимать только в контексте прочтения [заметок к релизу euler](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyberd/blob/master/docs/cyberd.md).

Основная цель заметки - объяснить логику наших решений связанных с дистрибьюцией CBD и CYB и доказать вам, что решение которые мы приняли несут в себе разумный баланс рисков с учетом целей и возможностей проекта.

Мы хотим быть достаточно прозрачными и честными с сообществом. Поэтому некоторая раскрытая информация может показаться Вам непривычной. Мы это понимаем, поймите и Вы нас.

## Раз

Первый значимый момент это то, что PoS будучи ахуенно экологичным и эффективным ставит перед создателем дюжую проблему с первоначальной дистрибьюцией.

Т.е. сеть не может просто взять так и получить бонды от валидаторов, если эти токены каким-то образом откуда-то у них не появились. В PoW все очень просто. Спалил электричества - создались токены. А во всяком случае с PoS легенда не говорит каким образом эти токены появятся :-)

Тем не менее первоначальная дистрибьюция должна быть доказуемая как PoW. Сейчас еще время такое, что асик может любой дурак придумать. Конечно, можно взять и изобрести [ProgPOW](https://github.com/ifdefelse/ProgPOW) или Ethash с хитрыми параметрами, но надолго этого не хватит.  Поэтому  если ты убежден что PoW действительно приводит к тому, что наши [деревья сьедают гусенцы](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9A%D0%B0%D1%88%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BD%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BC%D0%B8%D0%BD%D0%B8%D1%80%D1%83%D1%8E%D1%89%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%BC%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C), то тогда у тебя есть не так уж и много вариантов сделать дистрибьюцию которая не прибьет твой проект.

По большому счету есть всего два доказуемых варианта:

## Дропнуть

Хороший способ доказать что юзеры используют то, что ты сделал. Дроп это самый современный и эффективный способ привлечь юзеров. Дропы биткоина привлекают миллиарды долларов в случае если они 100%-ны. Но стопроцентные дропы возможны только в случае если нет необходимости инвестировать в кодовую базу. Если же проект делается с нуля, так как является чем-то приниципиально новым, то у проекта должны быть и деньги и разработчики, потому-что разрабочики питаются исклютельно деньгами.

## Cобрать бабло

Эффективный способ накормить разрабов деньгами это накормить их деньгами инвесторов. Но из тех кто прислал бабло всегда будут недовольные c чем проекту придется жить. У Биткоина не было подобного негатива, потому как не могло быть. Если у одного отдельно взятого человека нету денег, чтобы покрыть весь проект (а пока-что так умудрились сделать только Сатоши и ребята из Грин), тогда появляется необходимость привлекать бабло либо от людей которым ты доверяешь, либо от всех подряд. Привлечение денег от всех подряд всегда является риском для проекта тем более что сейчас регуляторам стало похуй на здравую логику. Поэтому приватные инвестиции от людей которым ты доверяешь является прекрасным выходом в такой ситуации если у проекта есть возможность сделать это быстро и эффективно. Для того, чтобы найти фандинг на доведение проекта до стабильного состояния мы так и посупим. К тому же это нам позволит больше фокусироваться на разработке, т.к. любые инвестиции это всегда лютые энергозатраты на взаимодействие с инвесторами.

## Два

Второй важный момент это то, что дистрибьюция всегда должна решать какую-то задачу. По сути всякая доказуемая дистрибьюция это микс между разными капиталами который приводит к текущему (успешному или нет) состоянию системы. От того у кого и как окажется токен значит очень многое, если не практически всё :-)

У нашего проекта есть практически классическая задача яица, дракона и бабла. Нам нужно связать разработчиков открытого кода с обыкновенными криптопользователями да так, чтобы капиталоимущие тоже могли помочь. Таким образом нам нужно сделать так, чтобы капитал изначально оказался и у обычных пользователей системы и у тех кто законтрибьютил капитал, и самое главное у разработчиков.

## Разрабам

Поэтому часть токенов все таки лучше распилить между разрабами. В нашем случае мы большинство кода уже написали сами, и поэтому существенную часть аллокации либо уже забрали себе, либо отдадим когда все допишем. А еще существенная часть из того, что достанется разрабам пойдет на полезные эксперименты. Токены достанутся трем (пока) исключительным экспериментам в области сетевых свармов: Gitcoin, Aragon и Colony.

## Три

А третий момент заключается в том, что еще нужно найти баланс в дистрибьюции между стаканом (инвесторами) и инженерной мыслью (девеолоперами). Потому как если этого не сделать, то девелоперы окажутся в форке, что плохо для инвесторов, т.к. в хорошей органической системе, такой например как эфир, инвесторы религиозно верят в девелоперов что выглядит достаточно синергично. Если девелоперы будут религиозно верить в инвесторов, то нихуя работать не будет.

Мы решили пойти методом при котором бабло и код равноценны и получают по 15% дистрибьюции, а юзерам уходит 70% CBD токенов.

Основная цель этой заметки - показать потенциальным контрибьютерам, что существующая оценка сформирована на основе действительных контрибьюций, и что в будущем при дистрибьюции не будет ситуаций при которых какая-то категория получит токены по оценке ниже, чем сформированная во время Генезис контрибьюции.

Правда в том, что мы по быстрее хотим избавиться от вопросов связанных с дистриьбьюцией, но проекту необходима мудрая структура первоначального капитала, как экономического, так и человеческого, чтобы превратиться во что-то действительно стоящее и мочь конкурировать с гигантами.

## Итого про дистрибьюцию токенов CBD

- Пруф кода: 15% для тех кто пишет код
- Пруф бабла: 15% для тех кто донатит бабло
- Пруф использования: 70% для как минимум 1 миллиона юзеров как минимум Эфира

На момент Генезиса основной сети владельцы CBD токенов получат львину долю CYB, за исключением инфляции аллоцированной валидаторам основной сети которая составит от 3% до 10% в зависимости от того, когда основная сеть будет запущена.

## Полезный тестнет

Очень важно понимать в чем разница между обычным блокчейн тестнетом и нашим тестнетом euler! Наш тестнет полезный и может быть начат использован для поиска прямо сейчас! Ссылки будут персистентны от тестнета к тестнету! Поэтому он может содержать в себе 1% монетарной ценности.

Т.о. мы решаем достаточно сложную проблему связанную с доставкой сложных продуктивных сетей и систем смартконтрактов. Они могут разрабатываться годами. Поэтому мы решили строить ракету во время полета. С одной стороны у нас есть уже что показать. Что-то что работает! И нам хочется чтобы этим начали пользоваться. С другой стороны могут быть вовлечены разные монетарные риски связанные с тем, что код еще молод. Поэтому мы решили найти компромис в виде эфир токенов CBD и токенов основной сети CYB.

## Proof-of-value: 15%

Те кто задонатил бабло грубо можно разделить на 2 группы:

Первая группа это бабло которое пойдет в киберКонгресс:
- Gensis раунд от команды: 4.1592% - уже сделали. Оценка 30k ETH. Не было софта.

> Тут стоит отметить что все дальнейшие предположения по оценке взялись из того, что с момента своего зачатия, два года донорами проекта являлись исключительно ребята из команды
киберКонгресса: 110.2 BTC + 380 ETH. За эти донаты команде аллоцировано 4.1592% от дистрибьюции CBD.

- Winter раунд от друзей: от 2.1153% до 4.1153% - зимний раунд. Этот раунд как раз сейчас в процессе.

Вторая группа это бабло которое пойдет в киберФаундейшн:

- 6.7255% - 8.7255% в зависимости от объема зимнего раунда. Это [Арагон организация](https://mainnet.aragon.org/#/cyberfoundation.aragonid.eth/0xf4d85b5a1650a335b30072d178f6dcb611f05a3e) которая сформирует свой капитал за счет публичного аукциона на причитающийся ей CBD. Аукцион будет похож на EOS с той разницей, что собранное бабло пойдет не в киберКонгресс, а под управление самого сообщества, т.е. в ДАО. С учетом того, что это по сути будет единственной возможностью закупиться массово токенами для валидаторов, думаю аукцион может собрать не менее 10k ETH в течение полутора лет.

## Proof-of-code: 15%

Те кто законтрибьютил код можно грубо разделить на 3 группы:

- Конгресс и изобретатели: 8.4%
- Команда: 3.8%
- Широкое комьюнити контрибьютеров: 2.8%

Логика может быть приблизительно следующей: команда расчитывала оценку своих опционов исходя из суммы персональных инвестиций и разумных целей.

Конгресс:

> 8.4% в натуральных деньгах по оценке $10M / 3 человека / 30 месяцев = ~10k$ на человека в месяц в зубы по текущей оценке

Команда:

> 2.8% в натуральных деньгах по оценке $10M / 9 человек / 18 месяцев = ~1.8k$ на человека в месяц в зубы по текущей оценке

Контрибьютеры:

В эту категорию будут входить не только баунти за простые работы по переводам, но и достаточно серьезные работы, такие как имплементации протокола на альтернативных языках, секьюрити баунти и тд. Около половины этого мешка будет распределено под контролем конгресса через Gitcoin. Вторую половину планируется аллоцировать на созадние [cyberColony](https://colony.io/).

Так как основателями киберКолонии будут яляются некоторые члены конгресса, рисков для дешевой утечки токенов так же не должно быть, но они могут присутствовать.

## Proof-of-use: 70%

Детали дистрибьюции можно узнать либо в заметках к релизу, но львиная доля дистрибьюции, а именно 70% уходит на дроп. Мы имеем еще шесть попыток оптимизировать дроп. Каждая попытка должна быть эффективнее предыдущей. Между дропами мы постараемся применять научный метод, чтобы их оптимизировать. В итоге мы надеемся достичь максимально возможной эффективной дистрибьюции в горизонте одного-двух лет за счет распределения юзерам, которые были полезны где-то на пространствах киберномики.

Отдельно взятым адресам будет алоцировано в диапозоне между %.0003 и %0.000003 что при оценке в 10 мультов между 30 баксами и 0.3 баксами. Я предполагаю что это разумные цифры, чтобы не ожидать массовго дампа токенов пользователями.

Тем не менее я ожидаю, что текущая конфигурация дистриьбюции в состоянии сгенерировать demand чтобы компенсировать supply даже от ста тысяч юзеров. Дело в том, что рынок валидаторов по опыту других сетей будет стремиться к 60% от суплая. При условии что токены возможно купить или заработать разными способами только на 30% суплая будет существовать спрос на ~30% суплая который будет возможно взять только от юзеров. В действительности для большей части валидаторов будет доступен только стейк от формирования cyberFoundation, а это в районе 8% что еще сильнее будет отражаться на формировании раннего спроса на токены со стороны валидаторов. Не стоит забывать и о юзерах, которые увидят внутреннюю ценность токенов.

Цель такого подхода к дистрибьюции - представить активным пользователям Эфира минимально возможный броадбанд, для того, чтобы оценить преимущества распределенного поиска. Маловероятно что какому либо из адресов с дропе хватит дропнутых токенов, чтобы стать валидатором, если только не в самом зародыше сети, когда на рынке валидаторов еще не сформировалась конкуренция.

## После Генезиса

К генезису фаза доказательства всем подряд закончится, т.е. кодом, баблом и использованием уже никому ничего доказать не сможешь :-) После Генезиса сеть перейдет в режим, когда новые токены будут создаваться только валидаторами.

С этого момента каждый блок валидаторы будут получать всегда фиксированное количество токенов: 1 000 000 000 CYB. Это будет базовым консенсусом по монетарной политике.

Мы выбрали инфляционный вариант, потому-что верим, что транзакционная маржа должна перетекать к тем, кто выполняет самую полезную функцию. Наш граф знаний не будет вычислен без валидаторов. Соответственно если мы хотим пожизненно иметь возможность пользоваться пропускной способностью системы мы должны пожизненно гарантировать валидаторам, что их затраты и риски будут компенсироваться из вечной фиксированной инфляции.

Чем дольше будет жить система, тем меньньшая относительная инфляция будет происходить.

## Почему все таки у нас два токена?

Несмотря на то, что технически мы могли бы обойтись без ERC-20 токена, тем не менее было решено что есть целый ряд факторов, почему он нам тем не менее нужен.

1. На ERC-20 токенах можно надежно учитывать опционы команде и подрядчикам в то время пока сеть нельзя назвать продуктивной на 100%

2. Развитие ликвидности CYB токена - долгий процесс. Шаги до запуска сетки могут усилить проект.

4. У нас есть другие проекты, такие как Academia и Chaingear которыми можно усилить токены на эфире.

3. Мы хотим активно развивать комьюнити на Gitcoin, но сделать это с токенами из внешней цепочки невозможно. Нам нужны ERC-20 токены чтобы добавить не кешевых стумулов для контрибьютеров.

5. Мы любим эфир, и хотим с ним жить :-)

6. Заработал Арагон, поэтому зачесались руки потрогать Арагон организации

7. Сформировать на базе CBD токенов эфир сообщество которому будет аллоцирована часть дистриьбюции CYB да так, чтобы 100% бабла осталось под контролем самого сообщества выглядит крайне соблазнительно, т.к. мы должны пробовать сделать очередную попытку повторить успех TheDAO.

В итоге у нас появились CBD токены, которые являются некими комьюнити токенами на эфире, которые дают разные суперсилы и артефакты :-) Мы рассматриваем токены на эфире как сторонний эффект организации, нежели основная суперсила. Основная суперсила это CYB т.к. они дают возможность валидировать и ранжировать. Но мы не планируем избавляться от CBD после запуска основной сети. Это вещество, которое может нам помогать делать много крутых штук.

## Долгосрочная перспектива

При том, что стартовая дистрибьюция выглядит слегка мудреной в отличие от Сатоши-стайл, она решает текущуе задачи проекта связанные с решением проблемы яица, драконов и бабла.

После активации сети `merkle` структура дистрибьюции становится простой и ориентирована на валидаторов, ключевая задача которые обеспечение консенсус компьютера необходимыми ресурсами для актуализации публичного общедоступного графа знаний.

Разрабатывая эту дистрибьюцию мы подумали о следующих вещах:

- баланс рисков вовлеченных в проект участников
- финансирование проекта в объеме `ровно столько сколько нужно`
- обеспечение структуры капитала долгосрочными стимулами

Модель выше предполагает, что проект достигнет `merkle` стадии на 50 млн блоке. При данном сценарии через 10 лет доля первоначальных инвесторов и разработчиков составит ~13.4%, а через 30 лет - всего 5.7%.
