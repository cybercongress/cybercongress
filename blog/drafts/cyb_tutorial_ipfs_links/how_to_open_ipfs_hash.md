First of all [download](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases) latest version of our Сyb and install it.

Next click on a Сyb icon. You can see something like this

So, let's copy ipfs hash from previous [post](https://steemit.com/web3/@savetheales/gitcoin-lovers), paste it in a search field and attach `.ipfs` to the and of hash.
