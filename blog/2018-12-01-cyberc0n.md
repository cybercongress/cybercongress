The history of contemporary web technologies is very interesting. Every time something truly exciting begins, people from all over the world meet around "some not obvious for every joe" idea.

The global Ethereum community started at [devcon0](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_BvvUlKDqp0&t=0s&list=PLJqWcTqh_zKEjpSej3ddtDOKPRGl_7MhS&index=2).

The Web3 community [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0IoUZdDi5Is) at the web3 summit.  The community around zero knowledge started at [Zcon0](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL40dyJ0UYTLK507afWUMgzUYeh-i4qQWS). The robonomics community [started](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cGN7T5yr7FQ) fat Robonomics 2017.

Over the last 5 years I have witnessed the tremendous pace of development of consensus computing. Starting from [naive bitcoin](https://litecoin.org/) forks we went from slow, dumb and expensive distributed ledgers to the state of the art consensus computers with [ultimate privacy](https://getmonero.org/), consensus computers with [self-evolving capabilities](https://tzscan.io/), consensus computers who are able to [prove computing costs ahead of execution](https://zp.io/), consensus computers who are able to [execute a code written (almost) in any language](https://www.bloks.io/), [mesh-like](https://thetangle.org/live) consensus computers, consensus computers which are [prepared for the quantum computing era](https://explorer.theqrl.org/).

Relax, this is the very beginning.  Proving skill sets of this [new life form](https://epicenter.tv/episode/252/) will evolve way faster than we can expect. In the following 7 years we will see a dawn of the new computing era in which consensus computers will compete for the role of [dominant artificial superintelligence](https://nickbostrom.com/superintelligence.html).

ASI is brand new thing. We have never seen AGI before. ASI we especially did not see. It is nearly impossible to predict how the area will develop, but I think that the following 3 statements will pass the truthfulness test in 7 years from now:

1. Consensus computing becomes the foundation of the third generation web.
2. Web3 can produce even larger amounts of public data than that produced by legacy web.
3. Web3 data becomes significantly easier to search, even easier than we are able to search now.

Using one app we will be able to search not only common terms, but exact pieces. We will be able to search not only online, but offline. We will be able to embed global search rights in our apps (!). We will be able to search using multidimensional scopes either physical or abstract. Robots also must be able to search without captcha or kyc. We will be able to search using just our thoughts. The cost of every search request will be lower by several orders of magnitude. Instead of 100 search requests per day we will do millions of search requests per day. It will help us to be more productive, to solve superhuman issues, etc.

For me, now the question is not whether will we do it or not, nor how will we do it, but how fast will we do it?

The last two years my research was primarily situated around the topic of distributed search across peer-to-peer networks using consensus computers and now I am pretty sure that this is not a problem that one human or even a bright team can easily solve. Despite the fact that the basics of the solution are quite simple, as always, the devil is in the details.

In the coming months I will cover the topic, but today I want to invite you to the first specialized conference around an [idea of decentralized search](https://steemit.com/web3/@hipster/an-idea-of-decentralized-search-for-web3-ce860d61defe5est).

I am pretty sure that a lot of you guys thought a lot about how we can replace the currently broken internet with web3. But before it happens we all must accept the fact that the current system has been primarily brought to the masses, brought to us because there was one simple app for web2. It is one simple input field which gave us so much. It brought us to the point where we are now. I can proudly say that thanks to this small input field I know (almost) everything I know now. It was with me for last the 19 years. It was with me the most of my conscious life.

But we learn nothing from our mistakes. At the Web3 Summit and Devcon4 we talked so much about web3 but we did almost nothing in order to replace proprietary Etherscan (special thanks to Igor for Blockscout), we did nothing to replace proprietary Infura, we did almost nothing to make our brand new networks become more discoverable (thanks to the guys from the Protocol labs for IPLD project).

Today I am writing to you because thanks to the [cyberCongress team](https://cybercongress.ai) I have hope:

![cyb+cyberd](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmVxaiY5DhVfTTYi4wiZ9CZ8MxVFGYreJ2jYdB2CrDSqtx)

This is a screenshot of a pure web3 browser that is able to search using experimental [cosmos based](https://github.com/cosmos/cosmos-sdk) blockchain network. You [can download Cyb](https://github.com/cybercongress/cyb/releases), you can [explore the code](https://github.com/cybercongress). The network is right now in its early days. The browser is not safe yet. But the network is able to compute Sybil resistant PageRank (for experimental purposes) for IPFS links using GPU. Cyb is able to deliver content from IPFS and interact with sites using Ethereum accounts. Together with cyberd search, they bring a user similar experience to that of web2. But! The browsing is much faster, responsive and has some very exciting properties which Chrome + Google + Metamask are unable to achieve: eg. (1) strong immunity to censorship, (2) really fast and responsive browsing and (2) (almost) safe and pretty signing experience. What a turn. Now I am able to play [Dragonereum](https://dragonereum.io/) like the Lord of cyber dragons!

So, I want to invite you to the first distributed search conference:

![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmdLnDPuyfzvwUmmJvW7U27CuAxYqznx2YXrYy6ij7osBQ)

We would love to discuss any ideas on how we can move further together.

 > But there's one more thing

I invite you to the event which is organized by a piece of autonomous code in a way that even [contract creators don't have control](https://github.com/cyberacademia/cyberc0n) over the  distribution of the event's results. I invite you to the first conference organized by a [smart contract](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61B81103e716B611Fff8aF5A5Dc8f37C628efb1E).

## How to buy a ticket?

We don't have ui for cyberc0n yet. We are going to deploy it in our web browser in a couple of days, but right now, the irony: Etherscan and Metamask allow you to call contracts using Chrome :-)

If you want to participate

1. Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61B81103e716B611Fff8aF5A5Dc8f37C628efb1E#writeContract)

2. Connect your Metamask
![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmYdFZariViiLNb6NttBTE8fRjQz8BbMqN6mxu4LeMdwkC)

3. Get the current auction price in wei

![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmetfq3JVgs9NFbAmHgsfyoo5uDiSrbBF24XmVhc2JjfmM)

4. Buy your ticket!

![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmPmu3YJ3Hf9jA6ce6C8Tmd9VuQVosQmT7zkfa1xCYUvz7)

5. Go to Minsk on 14 of December and do not forget the private key from your bidding account! You will need it to check-in!

6. After the end of check-in the contract will pay a difference between your bid and closing auction price.

Ticket price declines linearly from 3 ETH to 0.5 ETH right before the check-in starts.

There are 146 tickets. Not more not less. We do not have the time nor desire to do another huge conference. What we need is to continue our good [cyberFund](https://cyber.fund/) tradition aka Blockchain Fairytales and gather a small passioned community around the straightforward idea. Huge conferences also have huge upfront costs. Hence such limitations.

## How to apply for the talk?

1. Go to [Etherscan](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61B81103e716B611Fff8aF5A5Dc8f37C628efb1E#writeContract)

2. Fill out the six fields in applyForTalk method

![](https://ipfs.io/ipfs/QmXUuXfKk4Dgs4kE5sANdUtytzJYo3k31S2xUJmBDS7tU9)


- payableAmount. This is a bid of a speaker that will be returned in case of check-in on the event. By using these mechanics we try to bring participants some monetary assurance that the speaker will be at the event. Collateral will be returned on the day the conference ends by calling the distributeRewards function together with speakers rewards.

- speakerName and descSpeaker. This is your name and role the way you want to be presented! No censorship! Be the Lord of cyber dragons!

- deskTalk. A header of a Talk. We don't require you to show materials before. We know that you are cool people.

- duration. Duration of your talk in seconds.

- proof. Plain old web link to your twitter, blog or whatever proves that you are the real Gavin or Vitalik and not fake.

## How to get applied speakers?

Read the [14th method](https://etherscan.io/address/0x61B81103e716B611Fff8aF5A5Dc8f37C628efb1E#readContract) using index: 0, 1, 2 etc.

The 9th field is ApplicationStatus. If it is set to 1 your speakership is confirmed by organizer. We do not make a decision based on the collateral amount but based on your open source contributions to the topic of the conference. We have 24 slots. Some of them are for technical purposes to make possible getting the full schedule of the event from the blockchain.

## cyberc0n ticket game

By this event, we don't set a purpose to sell tickets at highest prices for the sake of organizers profit. The purpose of cyberAcademia is to just cover costs of the event for rent and food, cover risks of upfront costs and most importantly bring the best speakers into the game.

By doing a dutch auction where speakers trade with participants for the share of tickets revenue we want to address a traditional problem of dragons and eggs: speakers always confirm participation at the last moment, so people don't buy tickets until speakers are confirmed.

Our game is simple. We start from speakers’ share in tickets revenue at the level of 80% and finish at the level of 20%. So the rules are simple: the earlier good speakers get confirmed, the earlier the contract sells all tickets, the higher price participants will pay, the more share of revenue will be distributed to speakers.

We do not expect that speakers will be highly motivated by some ETH of revenue. But I am sure that these speakers are really interested in a proof of concept that such decentralized mechanisms can work in our industry at a larger scale.

My dream is to gather guys from Ethereum, Parity/Polkadot, IPFS/Filecoin, EOS, Cosmos, Monero, Zcash, Tezos and other communities  who are really excited about an idea of decentralized search.
