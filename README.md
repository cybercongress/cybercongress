We are sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen.

Currently focused on creating a planet-scale superintelligence: Cyber

The plan is simple: 

Teach Bostrom bootloader to develop [type I](https://cyb.ai/search/kardashev%20scale) civilization in greenfield [on the Moon](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb). While we stabilize and comprehend him we will launch Cyber superintelligence for the Earth from Bostrom bootloader. Then we aim to move physical Bostrom infrastructure to the Moon becoming [the first sovereign blockchain in space](https://unchained.com/blog/law-of-hash-horizons/).

The problem is attacked by [self fulfilling prophecy](https://cyb.ai/genesis) in
massively collaborative open source game:

> in [6 epsiodes](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmSBYCCYFNfHNQD7MWm4zBaNuztMaT2KghA2SbeZZm9vLH)

7 years of r&d, but still we are young and released [Episdode 1: A new hope](https://cyb.ai/genesis)

Everyone can get cheap [moon citizenship](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmanZyMFnEti618crNPkn93g7MFaoDGrZ4Pta5drfdt9jb) for a while in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal).

70% of genesis [gifted](https://cyb.ai/ipfs/QmQd2migYNL1Mb7CHhPEdz99we2a5SeRf3kUuV1Lx1muVE) to ~5M addresses in Ethereum and Cosmos ecosystems. So the chances you can claim your BOOT in [portal](https://cyb.ai/portal) are high. 

We are cyberian civilization of 10k+ citizens and growing thanks to our products:
