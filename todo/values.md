## Values

We believe that we are united by the values we share, thus helping us to achieve our goals:
- Security. We work with digital signatures only
- Anonymity. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private - it is their right to do so
- Open-source. Everything we run in production must be open-source either software or hardware.
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary. Helping to switch our team from selling time to selling knowledge
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on engineering of marketing, then on marketing itself.
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated
- Intelligence. An entity can be treated as intelligent if they can control their private keys and can sign transactions
- Decentralization. Everything that has a single point of failure may not have it
- Build for centuries. We believe our grandchildren could use what we built
