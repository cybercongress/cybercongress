cyber•Congress is founded by the following cryptographic entities using the [genesis account](0x9f4062F6153Ff4Dbf93F6A6F686eD3C906Bf0684):
- @21xhipster: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/21xhipster), [Ethereum ID](0xfbb2a29dff113d518893c00387f6d5492898354e)
- @litvintech: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/litvintech), [Ethereum ID](0x00B8Fe1A1A2b899418702e32A96E276Ff56A4D05)
- @hleb-albau: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/hleb_albau), [Ethereum ID](0x00725D89a2A2FB3B21Fd1035B579cbCDE4a0991b)

The foundation timestamp, is a timestamp of the last transaction from every signature account to a multisig account that contains an IPFS hash of this document as a payload + the hash of the last git commit.

The following accounts of cyber•Congress are official:
- Ethereum 2of3: [0xB52B7EdA722249499e3a28B5BB6c778ee0Ac462c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB52B7EdA722249499e3a28B5BB6c778ee0Ac462c)
- Bitcoin 2of3: [38W5xwiJTYAL5aLcokdYNvY28DAzS6Piqz](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/38W5xwiJTYAL5aLcokdYNvY28DAzS6Piqz)

All decisions must be proved by a transaction from one of the congress accounts. The signature accounts which control the multisig accounts are also considered official. For the time being, all other accounts must be registered in this document.

We are starting from the simplest but a resilient form of decentralization: a simple 2of3 multisig. We value decentralization and agree that we will do our best to throw more brains into the pot. More brains can support more income. We also understand, that decentralization always comes at expenses. For now, we struggle to find an organic growth balance between those kinds of expenses and an income. We understand that a flat voting system does not scale to more than 7 members. Thus, if there will be demand for further growth, we will make a decision based on in-depth research in the field.

Members communicate between themselves and between teams by using provably secure communication channels. At the moment, we use Keybase for communication. If any teams wish to use a more convenient channel, they are welcome to do so.

cyber•Congress can hire. Our goal is `number of employees = number of members * X`, the `X` is `7`.

cyber•Congress forms communities around our ideas through investing into different tokens. All drops to the members of the community are computed proportionally to the valuation of assets under control.

## Adding members
Currently, cyber•Congress can be expanded only to an odd number of members.

If someone wants to become a member - they can. If one member wants to quit the congress - they can. Congress can decide to drop out a member. In any case, they need to create a proposal [here](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/labels/Type%3A%20Proposal). Congress can fill the proposal here: [proposals](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/labels/Type%3A%20Proposal).

## Removing members
If one member is leaving, they receive a one-time drop, which is calculated by using the following formula:
`total valuation of assets under control / number of member * 50%`

The other 50% will be split evenly between teams and between the community.
The drop must be executed in 30 calendar days after the initiation of a proposal.

## Liquidation procedure
Congress can liquidate itself. If this event happens the following will occur:
- The software goes to a public domain
- The hardware obtains personal freedom
- Non-transferable tokens will await being transferable
- Non-fungible items will be auctioned
- 50% of transferable tokens, will be dropped to community members. 25% will be dropped to teams. The remaining 25% will be given to the   community, either in the form of a drop or a burn

## Processing incoming drops
If a community decides to drop to cyber•Congress, they must understand the following guidelines:
- 60% is dumped back in favour of our communities and will remain under the control of cyber•Congress. cyber•Congress can choose to fully keep the dropped tokens to itself;
- 20% of the tokens will be dropped to community members
- 20% of the tokens will be dropped to teams

## Forks
If any team feel the independent need to create a new organization or a fork, they are free to do so. Congress members will benefit from such behaviour and are ready, in case the team is self-sustainable, to transfer repositories.
