[@21xhipster](https://keybase.io/21xhipster), [@litvintech](https://keybase.io/litvintech), [@helb-albau](https://keybase.io/hleb_albau)

Version 1

## The Idea
The blockchain technology has opened the opportunity for development, which was impossible before. By this agreement, we define cyber•Congress, as a sovereign self-funded community of scientists, developers, engineers and craftsmen who create the foundation for a new kind of existence.

## The Mission
Helping the evolution of species

## Our Goals
- Build a strong scientific foundation behind cybernomics
- Provide an abundant access to information proved by transactions for all species
- Build an incentivization system for open-source communities and creators
- Make consensus computers more usable, scalable, performant and cheap
- Develop hardware interfaces and software protocols for ubiquitous, private and uncensored communications across universes
- Integrate post-quantum cryptography
- Develop open-source technologies for self-sustainable living
- Find an open approach for creating self-aware, self-replicating and economically independent robots
- Create mainstream tools for biological engineering and body augmentations
- Integrate cybernomics into humans, robots, animals, plants and other thinking formation
- Demolish all state borders across the universe
- Find an open approach for creating incentivized and decentralized AI
- Switch governmentally inclined business models from violent taxing to non-violent
- Create technologies for accessible space exploration and transportation
- Create technologies for the transfer of human consciousness to an electronic and digital environment
- Significantly extend living capabilities for all species up to - but not limited, to 10k years;
- Create the foundation for thermoregulation and for terraforming the Earth and other nearby planets
- Build the foundation for the emergence of unified spacetime ownership registry
- Participate in the development of Metaverse

## Our Values
We believe that our principles should be aligned with our values, thus helping us to achieve our goals:
- Security. We do not work with fiat or with bureaucratic paper hassle. We work only, with digital signatures
- Anonymity and privacy. If someone chooses to stay anonymous or private, it is their right to do so
- Open-source software. Everything we run in production must be open-source
- Open-source hardware. Every piece of hardware that goes into production, must be open-sourced
- Transparency. Transactional transparency is fundamental to community building
- Informational freedom. No local laws can prohibit the flow of any information
- Economic freedom. Nobody has the right to prevent or block transactions
- Free will. We reject corporate slavery bullshit, such as conflict of interest or NDA
- Capital, not salary. Helping to switch from dragging to the bottom salary, to capital based passive income for all
- Engineering is marketing. We would rather spend our resources on engineering then marketing
- Physical liberty. Limitations for physical liberty can be economic, but not authoritative
- Automation. Everything that can be automated, must be automated
- Intelligence. An entity can be treated as intelligent if she can control her private keys and is able to sign transactions
- Decentralization. Everything that can be decentralized, shall be decentralized
- Always on the edge. We try to offer alternatives to outdated technologies such as emails

## Stack
We are going to advance and deploy, the following technologies, available at the moment:

## Governance
cyber•Congress is founded by the following cryptographic entities using the [genesis account](0x9f4062F6153Ff4Dbf93F6A6F686eD3C906Bf0684):
- @21xhipster: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/21xhipster), [Ethereum ID](0xfbb2a29dff113d518893c00387f6d5492898354e)
- @litvintech: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/litvintech), [Ethereum ID](0x00B8Fe1A1A2b899418702e32A96E276Ff56A4D05)
- @hleb-albau: [Keybase ID](https://keybase.io/hleb_albau), [Ethereum ID](0x00725D89a2A2FB3B21Fd1035B579cbCDE4a0991b)

The foundation timestamp is a timestamp of the last transaction from every signature account to a multisig account, that contain an IPFS hash of this document as a payload + the hash of the last git commit.

The following accounts of cyber•Congress are official:
- Ethereum 2of3: [0xB52B7EdA722249499e3a28B5BB6c778ee0Ac462c](https://etherscan.io/address/0xB52B7EdA722249499e3a28B5BB6c778ee0Ac462c)
- Bitcoin 2of3: [38W5xwiJTYAL5aLcokdYNvY28DAzS6Piqz](https://blockchair.com/bitcoin/address/38W5xwiJTYAL5aLcokdYNvY28DAzS6Piqz)

All decisions must be proved by a transaction from one of the congress accounts. Signature accounts which control multisig accounts are also considered as official. All other accounts must be registered in this document for the time being.

We are starting from the simplest but a resilient form of decentralization: a simple 2of3 multisig. We value decentralization and agree that we will do our best to throw more brains into the pot. More brains can support more income. We also understand, that decentralization always comes at expenses. For now, we struggle to find an organic growth balance between those kind of expenses and an income. We understand that a flat voting system does not scale to more than 7 members. Thus, if there will be demand for further growth, we will make a decision based on in-depth research in the field.

Member communicate between themselves and between teams only by using provably secure communication channels. At the moment, we use Keybase for communication. If some teams wish to use a more convenient channel, they are welcome to do so.

cyber•Congress can hire. Our goal is `number of employees = number of members * X`, the `X` is `7`.

cyber•Congress forms communities around our ideas through investing into different tokens. All drops to the memebrs of the community are computed proportionally to the valuation of assets under control.

## Adding members
Currently, cyber•Congress can be expanded only to an odd number of members.

If someone wants to become a member - they can. If one member wants to quit the congress - they can. Congress can decide to drop out a member. In any case, they need to create a proposal [here :](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/labels/Type%3A%20Proposal). The Congress can fill the proposal from here: [proposals](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/labels/Type%3A%20Proposal).

## Removing members
If one member is leaving, they receive a one time drop, which is calculated by using the following formula:
`total valuation of assets under control / number of member * 50%`
The other 50% will be split evenly between teams and between the the community.
The drop, must be executed in a period of 30 calendar days after the initiation of a proposal.

## Liquidation procedure
The congress can liquidate itself. If this event happens the following will occur:
- The software, goes to a public domain;
- The hardware obtains personal freedom;
- Non-transferable tokens will await being transferable;
- Non-fungible items, will be auctioned;
- 50% of transferable tokens, will be dropped to community members. 25% will be dropped to teams. The remaining 25% will be given to the   community, either in the form of a drop or a burn;

## Processing incoming drops
If a community, decides to drop to cyber•Congress, they must understand the following guidelines:
- 60% are dumped back, in favor of our communities and remain under the control of cyber•Congress. cyber•Congress can choose to fully     keep the dropped tokens;
- 20% of the tokens will be dropped to communty members;
- 20% of the tokens will be dropped to teams;

## Forks
If some team feel the independent need to create a new organization or a fork, they are free to do so. Congress members will benefit such behavior and are ready, in case the team is self sustainable, to transfer repositories.

## Functions
- Asset management: control of keys, [investment decisions](https://ethplorer.io/address/0xb52b7eda722249499e3a28b5bb6c778ee0ac462c),     forecasting;
- Community building: continuous development of our [portal](https://github.com/cybercongress);
- Delivery pipeline: improving our development [pipeline](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/pipeline.md);
- Internal projects: formed as proposals in [issues](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress/issues), until merged into the master       branch of [congress](https://github.com/cybercongress/congress), will become a standalone repository or be closed;
- Project management: one project = one repo = at least one owner. Every project has independent minor 0.x.0 or 0.0.x release pipeline,   like [chaingear](https://github.com/cybercongress/chaingear);
- Product delivery: putting repositories together, can form a [product](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects) and its           [environment](https://github.com/topics/cyber-search). Product releases, are major releases across all projects like x.0.0;
- Roadmap evolution: keeping the [roadmap](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/projects/1) up to date;
- Payroll execution: at the end of every sprint, there should be a transaction/s, according to the forecast given prior;
- Team incentivization: developing options for major releases;
- Team building: every project or product, can have a [team](https://github.com/orgs/cybercongress/teams);
- Release perfection: quality control through publicly signed major releases;
- Running sprints: planning of 2-week sprints on Mondays. Demo / retrospective and closing sprints, on Fridays;
- Invent blocks: Every seventh sprint is a block, like Phangan, but better;
- Knowledge sharing / transfering and mentoring, for team members;
- Help team members to switch from salary-based, to capital-based income;

This list of functions is exclusive. If someone wishes to add something, they can try to guess what they need to do in order to complete the task.

## Products
The current product priority, is the following:
- cyber•Search
